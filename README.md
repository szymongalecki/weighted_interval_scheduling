# Weighted Interval Scheduling
Consider a set of *n* intervals *I<sub>1</sub>, ..., 
I<sub>N</sub>*, each given as an integer tuple *(s<sub>i</sub>, f<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>)* 
with *s<sub>i</sub> < f<sub>i</sub>*, such that the *i*<sup>th</sup> interval starts at *s<sub>i</sub>*, 
ends at *f<sub>i</sub>* and has weight *w<sub>i</sub>*.  

We want to determine the maximum total weight of a subset of the nonoverlapping intervals.
